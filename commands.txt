git status is the important command

Command learned
git init
git status
git add <file>
git commit -m ""
git diff <file> After making changes to the staged file (after git add) Compare the diff
git restore <file> (To restore to the staged version) 
git reset <file> (To remove the file from stage and start over)
git rm --cached <file> (To remove the file from stage)
git log
